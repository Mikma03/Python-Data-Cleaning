# Python-Data-Cleaning

Tools and techniques that you can apply to clean and handle data with Python. 

Cover recipes on using supervised learning and Naive Bayes analysis to identify unexpected values and classification errors, and generate visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize unexpected values.


## Following topics are in this repositary:

- Find out how to read and analyze data from a variety of sources

- Produce summaries of the attributes of data frames, columns, and rows

- Filter data and select columns of interest that satisfy given criteria

- Address messy data issues, including working with dates and missing values

- Improve your productivity in Python pandas by using method chaining

- Use visualizations to gain additional insights and identify potential data issues

- Enhance your ability to learn what is going on in your data

- Build user-defined functions and classes to automate data cleaning


I found an interesting article on data cleansing some time ago on the Towards data Science page on Medium. As a complement to this repository, I am enclosing a link.
